# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Redux Store (store.js)
Creates a global store using createStore.
Persists data using redux-persist and AsyncStorage, 
so messages don‚Äôt disappear on app restart.
persistReducer wraps the root reducer to enable persistence.
Exports store and persistor to manage state.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Reducer (reducers.js)
Manages the messages array in Redux state.
Listens for the "ADD_MESSAGE" action to append new messages.
Returns unchanged state if no recognized action is dispatched.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Action Creator (actions.js)
Defines addMessage(message), which:
Returns an action with type "ADD_MESSAGE".
Sends the message as payload to the reducer.

ü§î How It Works
Messages are stored in Redux and persisted using AsyncStorage.
The reducer updates the state when ADD_MESSAGE is dispatched.
The app can access and display messages even after reload.
